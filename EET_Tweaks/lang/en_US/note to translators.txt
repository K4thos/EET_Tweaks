Most of EET Tweaks strings are already translated elsewhere, mostly in original games. Check out the comments for strings, as they often show where to look at for translated string.

prompts.tra - this is a common file with weidu constants strings. There are many mods that come with such file, so you can just copy it over without any changes.

areas.tra - if EET has been translated to your langauage than this file is almost a direct copy of map_mods_trans.tra from that mod. You can also find many of these strings translated in BP-BGT Worldmap. Check out string numbers added as comments. Also check if Miloch's Sword Coast Map Labels mod is available in your language for even more translated strings. ### instead of spaces and area names instead of string numbers are not a mistake. This file is not directly loaded, but EET reads it during installation to get these strings.

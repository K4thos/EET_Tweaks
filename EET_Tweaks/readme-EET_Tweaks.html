<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="section">

<p>Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition Trilogy Tweaks (EET Tweaks) is a modification that offers several optional tweaks for Infinity Engine games.</p>

</div>

<!-- ================== C o m p a t i b i l i t y ================== --><a id="compatibility" name="compatibility"></a>
<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<div class="section">
<p>Most tweaks have been designed with <acronym title="Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition Trilogy">EET</acronym> platform in mind. Some will also work with following games: <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym>, <acronym title="Baldur's Gate 2">BG2</acronym>, <acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym>, <acronym title="Icewind Dale 2">IWD2</acronym>, <acronym title="BG To Two">Tutu</acronym>, <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym>, <acronym title="Classic Adventures">CA</acronym>, <acronym title="Icewind Dale in Baldur's Gate 2">IWD-in-BG2</acronym>, <acronym title="Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition">BG:EE</acronym>, <acronym title="Baldur's Gate 2: Enhanced Edition">BG2:EE</acronym>, <acronym title="Icewind Dale: Enhanced Edition">IWD:EE</acronym> (refer to description of each tweak for platform compatibility list).</p>
<p>In terms of installation order, EET Tweaks should be installed last or close to last. Specifically, it should be installed after any mods which add or alter CRE, BCS, DLG, ITM, SPL, EFF files.</p>
<p>If the tweak description mentions that the same or similar functionality is available elsewhere than EET Tweaks will skip component installation if conflicting component is installed already. This is why the preferable install order would be after mods that are recognizable by EET Tweaks, such as BG2 Tweaks and others.</p>

</div>

<h2>Consistent NPCs</h2>
<div class="section">

<h3>Edwin appearance</h3>
<p>Compatibility: EET</p>
<p>Choose which game should be used as a base for this NPC colours and portrait.</p>
<p>Available options:</p>
<ol>
	<li>BG1</li>
	<li>BG2</li>
</ol>

<h3>Imoen appearance</h3>
<p>Compatibility: EET</p>
<p>Choose which game should be used as a base for this NPC colours and portrait.</p>
<p>Available options:</p>
<ol>
	<li>BG1</li>
	<li>BG2</li>
	<li>SoD</li>
</ol>

<h3>Jaheira appearance</h3>
<p>Compatibility: EET</p>
<p>Choose which game should be used as a base for this NPC colours and portrait.</p>
<p>Available options:</p>
<ol>
	<li>BG1</li>
	<li>BG2</li>
</ol>

<h3>Minsc appearance</h3>
<p>Compatibility: EET</p>
<p>Choose which game should be used as a base for this NPC colours and portrait.</p>
<p>Available options:</p>
<ol>
	<li>BG1</li>
	<li>BG2</li>
</ol>

<h3>Viconia appearance</h3>
<p>Compatibility: EET</p>
<p>Choose which game should be used as a base for this NPC colours and portrait.</p>
<p>Available options:</p>
<ol>
	<li>BG1</li>
	<li>BG2</li>
	<li>SoD</li>
</ol>

<h3>Cameo NPCs appearance</h3>
<p>Compatibility: EET</p>
<p>Gives BG1 appearance (colours and portraits) to NPCs that shows up in BG2 portion of the game, but are not join-able (at least in vanilla game).</p>

<h3>NPCs voices</h3>
<p>Compatibility: EET</p>
<p>Inconsistency between voice artists and/or performance in BG1 and BG2 is a big problem in some non English versions of the game. This component will do it's best to make them consistent in both portion of the story by either adding/replacing/removing sound files. Currently it only works for Polish version of the game, but I'm open for adding support for different languages if someone is interested in contributing the code.</p>

<p>This component affects following BG1 NPCs:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Edwin</li>
	<li>Imoen</li>
	<li>Jaheira</li>
	<li>Minsc</li>
	<li>Viconia</li>
	<li>Wraith Sarevok</li>
</ul>

<p>Available options:</p>
<ol>
	<li>BG1 values (default in EET)</li>
	<li>BG2 values (if you are using EET/BGT/Tutu than keep in mind that it's way to high for BG1 portion of the game, but consider installing it after starting BG2)</li>
	<li>Vanilla friendly progressive (with default XP CAP your thief and mage will earn the same XP rewards as in BG1. Later in the game rewards increases progressively to end up on BG2:ToB values when your thief reaches maximum level and about half of the maximum XP for level 9th spells)</li>
	<li>Disabled (pen and paper accurate)</li>

<p>As above but for quests. It edits XPLIST.2da, as well as all BCS, DLG, ITM, SPL, EFF files (also affects mods).</p>

<p>This tweak converts every single party XP reward in game (also affects mods) to rewards distributed individually for each of the party member. It will affect solo and smaller party players significantly, but total XP pool is not changed by this tweak (excluding integer rounding), so if you are playing with party of 6 you won't notice any difference in your game because all party members will receive their XP.</p>

</div>

<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<div class="section">

<h3>Disable hostile reaction after charm</h3>
<p>Compatibility: BG2, Tutu, BGT (BGT version also available in BGT Tweaks mod), CA, IWD-in-BG2, BG:EE, BG2:EE, IWD:EE, EET</p>
<p>Simple tweak ported from BGT Tweaks. Changes the 'Charm Specific Creature' effect in all ITM, SPL and EFF files to disable hostile reaction after Charm/Dire Charm effect ends (also affects mods).</p>

<h3>PnP spell scroll caster levels (by AstroBryGuy)</h3>
<p>Compatibility: BG2, Tutu, BGT, CA, IWD-in-BG2, BG:EE, BG2:EE, IWD:EE, EET<br />
Conceptually incompatible with BG2 Tweaks' "Cast Spells from Scrolls at Character Level" tweak (skipped if you installed it)</p>
<p>This tweak sets the caster level of spell scrolls to be the minimum caster level for the spell + 1, with a minimum caster level of 6 (as per the Dungeon Master's Guide). This tweak only affects spell scrolls in which the spell resource uses vanilla prefixes: SPWI and SPPR.</p>

<p>For wizard spells, the minimum caster level is set to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>1st - 3rd: 6</li>
	<li>4th: 8</li>
	<li>5th: 10</li>
	<li>6th: 13</li>
	<li>7th: 15</li>
	<li>8th: 17</li>
	<li>9th: 19</li>
</ul>
<p>For priest spells, the minimum caster level is set to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>1st - 3rd: 6</li>
	<li>4th: 8</li>
	<li>5th: 10</li>
	<li>6th: 12</li>
	<li>7th: 15</li>
</ul>

<h3>Familiar death consequences</h3>
<p>Compatibility: EET</p>
<p>Normally when your familiar is killed summoner looses 1 Constitution point permanently. This tweak allows you to change this behaviour. Familiars in EET are completely unhardcoded, so adjusting such things is easier.</p>
<p>Available options:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Constitution loss & blocked summoning for 1 week (after this time Constitution stat will return to previous value and you will be able to once again use 'Summon familiar' spell)</li>
	<li>Constitution loss for 1 week (toned down version of above)</li>
	<li>Disabled</li>
</ol>

<h3>Protagonist can die</h3>
<p>Compatibility: BG2:EE, EET</p>
<p>Adds a flag to all areas in game to prevent Game Over screen when protagonist dies, but other party members are still alive (also affects mods). Tweak can be disabled in-game by setting K#DISABLE_PC_CAN_DIE global variable to 1.</p>
<!--
<p>Available options:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Protagonist can die</li>
	<li>Protagonist can be either Imprisoned, Petrified or Charmed (Bhaal essence is lost only when character really dies or there is no one left to bring him/her back from middle death state)</li>
</ol>
-->

<!--
<h3>Ironman Mode</h3>
-->

<h3>One time area spawn points</h3>
<p>Compatibility: BG:EE, BG2:EE, EET</p>
<p>Disables area spawn point after creature is spawned for the first time (no respawning).</p>

</div>

<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<div class="section">

<h3>Add Priest of Tempus kit for Priests</h3>
<p>Compatibility: BG:EE, BG2:EE, EET (skipped if you installed IWD-in-EET)</p>
<p>Implements playable Priest of Tempus kit from IWD:EE.</p>

<h3>More bandit scalps</h3>
<p>Compatibility: BG:EE, EET, BGT</p>
<p>More BG1 bandits shall have scalps when you install this component.</p>

<h3>FPS & cutscenes audio adjustment</h3>
<p>Compatibility: BG2, Tutu, BGT, CA, IWD-in-BG2, BG:EE, BG2:EE, IWD:EE, EET</p>
<p>The problem with increasing game framerate is annoying audio skipping in some cutscenes. This tweak should automatically fix most of such problems in vanilla Bioware content (just a guess based on what I've already tested). If you are using non English voices that are longer than original ones (in such cases they are usually also problematic even on 30 FPS) than this tweak may be a little less effective, but you should still notice major improvements. In the current version it works best with the cutscene coding present in vanilla BG2 and ToB. Due to the way Beamdog cutscenes are designed automatic approach doesn't work as intented (e.g. revised Sarevok ambush cutscene and Black Pits cutscenes will still have audio problems).<p>
<p>PST:EE engine addeded few new triggers that can be used to bypass this problem but they are not available in other EE games yet. I'm planning to solve this in future if the engine will be ever updated to support those.</p> 
<p>Available options:</p>
<ol>
	<li>60 FPS</li>
	<li>45 FPS</li>
	<li>Custom value (type in integer value up to 60)</li>
</ol>

<h3>Remove junk from global scripts</h3>
<p>Compatibility: BG2:EE, EET</p>
<p>Vanilla game script coding lefts a lot to be desired performance wise when it comes to handling global scripts stuff (code that is working constantly for the entire game). This tweak aims to remove things from BALDUR.BCS and BALDUR25.BCS that can be achieved locally, which in the end should result in better in-game performance. Some things from the below list may be skipped during installation if some other mod already changed the default implementation.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Cleric's Holy Symbols - this is probably the worst offender. As far as I know <em>HasItem</em> trigger is one of the most demanding ones in IE games. In order to give Cleric a Holy Symbol at level 25 (something that will be done maybe once or twice in the late BG2 portion of the game) there are 24 blocks with this trigger that are parsed at the same frame during entire game, whenever global script is in use. Whatever was the reason for this (looks like a thing adopted from G3 BG2 Fixpack) the implementation is just bad. This tweak changes CDHLYSYM.SPL to spawn an invisible creature with local script attached that will do exactly the same thing without any performance hit.</li>
	<li>Lilarcor (talking sword) - another situation where demanding triggers are used without good enough reason. Fortunately with a timer delay, but still talking weapons in global scripts are a known factor for FPS drops in IE games. Lilarcor has now new item effect added that will spawn invisible creature when item is equipped.</li>
	<li>Unused test script blocks - BALDUR.BCS contains some leftover code used for testing textscreens that can be wiped out without any effect on game.</li>
	<li>Unused Familiar script blocks with wrong DV - BALDUR25.BCS has references to not existing familiar Death Variables which can be safely removed.</li>
	<li>Drow items changing to dust on surface - not so demanding for the engine thanks to the Global trigger, but still controversial when you consider that the same variable is checked 84 times in the same frame (even more if you are using mods that adds additional drow items) for the whole ToB portion of the game (only present in BALDUR25.BCS). This tweak will again spawn an invisible creature with local script, this time in all areas that sets <em>oh_drow_items_safe</em> variable to 0 (also affects mods).</li>
	<li>Malchior Harpell's appearance - moved the spawning method from BALDUR.BCS to AR0800.BCS. Due to this change it's possible to evade Harpell completely if you don't enter Athkatla Graveyard District (first place where you can meet him) with Drizzt's equipment, but I think that's still better than playing whole game game with 8 useless PartyHasItem checks present in global script. The way this has been originally coded (<a href="https://forum.baldursgate.com/discussion/30392/melchor-harpell-way-to-rip-me-out-of-my-immersion/p1">constantly respawning encounter</a>) is silly either way, so not much loss. I would call it improvement actually. No conflicts with <em>BG2 Tweaks - Keep Drizzt's Loot, Disable Malchor Harpell</em> component.</li>
	<li>Leftover BG:EE ARE scripts code - this is unrelated to global scripts, but still worth cleaning. In 2 cases (AR0514.BCS, AR2001.BCS) leftovers can be harmful for BG2 portion of the game because there is junk BG:EE code in scripts attached to existing areas. That is why this component fixes it via REPLACE_BCS_BLOCK. Additionally there are 33 harmless ARE scripts leftover that don't have corresponding area files (they exist only in BG:EE) - these are also cleaned to make working with Near Infinity tool faster and more reliable (no false reports when searching for resources in scripts). Ideally, it would be officially handled by Beamdog <a href="http://forum.baldursgate.com/discussion/39661/junk-data-from-bg1-scripts-in-bg2-wrong-script-attached-to-are">via patch</a>, but until it happens this tweak will do the job.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Import party items to SoA</h3>
<p>Compatibility: EET</p>
<p>This component transfers your BG1 inventory into Irenicus Dungeon (table near duergars).</p>

<h3>Books/Scrolls categorization</h3>
<p>Compatibility: BG:EE, BG2:EE, EET</p>
<p>This tweak automatically categorizes Book and Scroll item files to use appropriate category (if needed) in order to make them storable in Scroll Case (impossible if the item uses Miscellaneous category, which is often the case for Books and sometimes for Scrolls). Items referenced in ITEMDIAL.2DA, ITEMSPEC.2DA and Books with effects and/or abilities are excluded from categorization. Category detection is done by comparing default ground icons assigned to items (GBOOK01 for books, GSCRL01.BAM for scrolls).</p>
<p>The component also changes 16 'Dusty Books' scattered around the Durlag’s Tower floors, that usually only have one line written in them, into scrolls (with name changed to 'Dusty Page', appropriate Inventory, Ground, Description icons, weight and price assigned). This makes them copyable into Journal and I think makes a bit more sense - why would Durlag use an entire 2 pounds book to write one line of information?</p>

<h3>Wand Case (by Mortianna)</h3>
<p>Compatibility: BG2, Tutu, BGT, BG:EE, BG2:EE, EET</p>
<p>Adds Wand Case that can keep your wands the same way as Bag of Holding holds other items. The Wand Case may be purchased from Thalantyr at High Hedge, at Ribald’s Adventurer’s Mart in SoA and the Saradush Tavern in ToB.</p>
<p></p>

<h3>Key Ring</h3>
<p>Compatibility: EET (other versions may come in future if someone will contribute converted BAM inventory icon)</p>
<p>Adds Key Ring that can keep your keys the same way as Bag of Holding holds other items. The Key Ring may be purchased from Thalantyr at High Hedge, at Ribald’s Adventurer’s Mart in SoA and the Saradush Tavern in ToB.</p>
<p>It's the exact same item that is added to your inventory during Siege of Dragonspear but under different name, so keys won't be shared between different Key Rings.</p>

<h3>Replace classic BG1 movies with BG:EE ones</h3>
<p>Compatibility: EET</p>
<p>By default EET imports all classic BG1 movies rather than using EE variants. This tweak allows you to rewert this implementation. Second option also can disable classic BG1 movies that don't have variants in BG:EE (13 movies).<p>
<p>Available options:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Replace movies</li>
	<li>Also disable BG1 movies that don't have BG:EE variants</li>
</ol>

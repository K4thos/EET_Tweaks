<div class="content">
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition Trilogy Tweaks (EETT) is a modification that offers several optional tweaks for Infinity Engine games. Mostly related to Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET) mod, but some are more universal and will work with different games and IE engine versions.</p>

<p>The components of this modification are:</p>
<hr />

<h3>Teleport spell</h3>
<p>Compatibility: EET</p>
<p>Leftover from the earlier version of EET that didn't have native worldmap support for going back to BG1 areas after starting BG2. Teleport is still a nice and lore friendly feature, so it's now part of this tweak pack. Learning this spell will allow your party fast travel to areas that you have previously visited. Additionally modders can use this spell for easier mod debugging by typing in the console: SetGlobal("K#DebugMode","GLOBAL",1) which will enable teleportation to all areas regardless if you visited them. The spell itself can be bought from Lazarus in ToB after completing his quest (the one with Lazarus' Teleport Scroll). You can also spawn it via console: CreateItem("K#TELSPL",1)</p>
<hr />

<h3>Consistent NPC appearance</h3>
<p>Compatibility: EET (BGT version will be added soon)</p>
<p>Choose which game should be used as a base for join-able NPCs colours and portraits. This component will read all the data from one of the NPC CRE files introduced in the chosen game and apply it to all other CRE files that have been added by both games. Affected NPCs: Edwin, Imoen, Jaheira, Minsc, Viconia, Dorn, Neera, Rasaad. It also gives BG1 appearance (no matter which option you choose) to NPCs that shows up in BG2 portion of the game, but are not join-able (at least in vanilla game). Available options:</p>
<p><a href="#" onclick="toggle('Consistent NPC appearance'); return false;">Unhide/Collapse details</a></p>
<ul class="vlisthide" id="Consistent NPC appearance">
	<li>BG1</li>
	<li>BG2</li>
</ul>
<hr />

<h3>Consistent NPC voices</h3>
<p>Compatibility: EET (BGT version will be added soon)</p>
<p>Inconsistency between voice artists and/or performance in BG1 and BG2 is a big problem in non English versions of the game. This component will do it's best to make them consistent in both portion of the story by either adding/replacing/removing sound files. Currently it only works for Polish version of the game, but I'm open for adding support for different languages if someone is interested in tweaking the code. This component affects following BG1 NPCs:</p>
<p><a href="#" onclick="toggle('Consistent NPC voices'); return false;">Unhide/Collapse details</a></p>
<ul class="vlisthide" id="Consistent NPC voices">
	<li><strong>Edwin</strong>: Robert Płuszka plays the role in both games, so there is no need for special treatment. Just added some sounds to BG1 CRE files that were introduced in BG2 (comments on nature, more attack taunts etc.)</li>
	<li><strong>Imoen</strong>: it's hard to believe but the same voice actress (Anna Dużyńska) played the role in both games. The problem is that in BG1 for whatever stupid reason she used Russian accent and sounds nothing like in BG2. That is why she will now use her BG2 voice set (from later part of game, not those pessimistic lines from Irenicus Dungeon). Remaining original BG1 tracks are replaced with dummy (silent) files.</li>
	<li><strong>Jaheira</strong>: Henryka Korzycka plays the role in both games, but she did MUCH better job in BG2 (compare "For the fallen!" line for example). So her lines remains mostly unchanged, but voices for common actions has been replaced with BG2 ones if they were available.</li>
	<li><strong>Minsc</strong>: similar situation to Imoen - same voice actor (Janusz Marcinowicz), awesome BG2 performance, and totally different direction in BG1, where he sounds nothing like the English voice actor or his BG2 performance (I had to listen to his lines over and over to even believe that it is the same person). Simply bland and even worse he is often mispronouncing Boo name in BG1 :( That is why all sounds are replaced with BG2 ones and remaining BG1 tracks are replaced with dummy (silent) files.</li>
	<li><strong>Viconia</strong>: Gabriela Kownacka plays the role in both games, great performance, so she keeps all of her BG1 voices and receives additional sounds introduced in BG2 (see Edwin)</li>
	<li><strong>Wraith Sarevok</strong>: touched up Sarevok's (Daniel Olbrychski) Hell Trials speech to be more in line with his BG1 performance and his current spiritual appearance. During Hell Trials Sarevok uses the same, fully armoured animation as in BG1, so it didn't make sense that the Wraith had crystal clear voice as in ToB.</li>
</ul>
<hr />

<h3>Additional XP CAP for SoA portion of the game</h3>
<p>Compatibility: EET</p>
<p>Like in vanilla game EET doesn't have pre ToB XP CAP. This tweak allows to add it into the game for those who don't like to be overpowered in Shadows of Amn portion of the game. It expands BALDUR.BCS file. Available options:</p>
<p><a href="#" onclick="toggle('Additional BG2:EE SoA XP CAP'); return false;">Unhide/Collapse details</a></p>
<ul class="vlisthide" id="Additional BG2:EE SoA XP CAP">
	<li><strong>2,500,000</strong> (BG2:ToB starting XP for NPC)</li>
	<li><strong>2,950,000</strong> (BG2 without expansion XP CAP)</li>
	<li><strong>Custom value</strong> (type in integer value)</li>
</ul>
<hr />

<h3>Adjust XP CAP for BG1 portion of the game</h3>
<p>Compatibility: EET</p>
<p>Just like vanilla BG:EE, EET adds XP CAP to BG1 portion of the game. You can adjust it or disable completely here. Available options:</p>
<p><a href="#" onclick="toggle('Adjust BG:EE XP CAP'); return false;">Unhide/Collapse details</a></p>
<ul class="vlisthide" id="Adjust BG:EE XP CAP">
	<li><strong> 89,000</strong> (BG2:EE starting XP)</li>
	<li><strong>161,000</strong> (BG:EE XP CAP - default)</li>
	<li><strong>Disable XP CAP</strong> (sets XP CAP to 100,000,000)</li>
	<li><strong>Custom value</strong> (type in integer value)</li>
</ul>
<hr />

<h3>Adjust total XP CAP</h3>
<p>Compatibility: BG2:EE, EET</p>
<p>Simply adjusts whole game XP CAP via editing XPCAP.2DA and STARTARE.2DA files. Available options:</p>
<p><a href="#" onclick="toggle('Adjust BG2:EE XP CAP'); return false;">Unhide/Collapse details</a></p>
<ul class="vlisthide" id="Adjust BG2:EE XP CAP">
	<li><strong>2,950,000</strong> (BG2 without expansion XP CAP)</li>
	<li><strong>8,000,000</strong> (BG2:EE XP CAP - default)</li>
	<li><strong>Disable XP CAP</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Custom value</strong> (type in integer value)</li>
</ul>
<hr />

<h3>Adjust XP for Traps, Spells and Lockpicking</h3>
<p>Compatibility: BG2, Tutu, BGT, CA, IWD-in-BG2, BG:EE, BG2:EE, IWD:EE, EET</p>
<p>Adjust XP rewards for disarming Traps, learning Spells and Lockpicking via editing XPBONUS.2DA. Available options:</p>
<p><a href="#" onclick="toggle('Adjust XP for Traps, Spells and Lockpicking'); return false;">Unhide/Collapse details</a></p>
<ul class="vlisthide" id="Adjust XP for Traps, Spells and Lockpicking">
	<li><strong>Use XP values from BG1</strong> (default in EET)</li>
	<li><strong>Use XP values from BG2</strong> (if you are using EET/BGT/Tutu than keep in mind that it's way to high for BG1 portion of the game, but consider installing it after starting BG2)</li>
	<li><strong>Vanilla friendly progressive</strong> (with default XP CAP your thief and mage will earn the same XP rewards as in BG1. Later in the game rewards increases progressively to end up on BG2:ToB values when your thief reaches maximum level and about half of the maximum XP for level 9th spells)</li>
	<li><strong>Disable XP for disarming traps, lockpicking, spell learning</strong> (pen and paper accurate)</li>
	<li><strong>Custom value</strong> (type in integer percentage value)</li>
</ul>
<hr />

<h3>Adjust XP for killing creatures</h3>
<p>Compatibility: BG2, Tutu, BGT, CA, IWD-in-BG2, BG:EE, BG2:EE, IWD:EE, EET</p>
<p>Adjust XP rewards for killing monsters. Edits all CRE files in game (also affects mods). Available options:</p>
<p><a href="#" onclick="toggle('Adjust XP for killing creatures'); return false;">Unhide/Collapse details</a></p>
<ul class="vlisthide" id="Adjust XP for killing creatures">
	<li><strong>Increase to 150%</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Decrease to 75%</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Decrease to 50%</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Decrease to 25%</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Decrease to 10%</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Disable</strong> (no XP for killing creatures)</li>
	<li><strong>Custom value</strong> (type in integer percentage value)</li>
</ul>
<hr />

<h3>Adjust XP for quests</h3>
<p>Compatibility: BG2, Tutu, BGT, CA, IWD-in-BG2, BG:EE, BG2:EE, IWD:EE, EET</p>
<p>As above but for quests. It edits XPLIST.2da, as well as all BCS, DLG, ITM, SPL, EFF files (also affects mods). Available options:</p>
<p><a href="#" onclick="toggle('Adjust XP for quests'); return false;">Unhide/Collapse details</a></p>
<ul class="vlisthide" id="Adjust XP for quests">
	<li><strong>Increase to 150%</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Decrease to 75%</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Decrease to 50%</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Decrease to 25%</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Decrease to 10%</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Disable</strong> (no XP for quests)</li>
	<li><strong>Custom value</strong> (type in integer percentage value)</li>
</ul>
<hr />

<h3>Party XP for quests distributed individually</h3>
<p>Compatibility: BG2, Tutu, BGT, CA, IWD-in-BG2, BG:EE, BG2:EE, IWD:EE, EET</p>
<p>You think that you are really good player because you were able to solo the game? I thought so too until I played Black Pits 2 solo which has different XP reward system than vanilla game - each party member receives XP individually, which means you are not rewarded with more XP if you have smaller party. This tweak does exactly the same thing but for whole BG saga (also affects mods). I highly recommend it (together with reducing XP for creatures that still adds XP to whole party) for veterans as it truly offers hardcore solo or smaller party challenge. Total XP pool is not changed by this tweak (excluding integer rounding), so if you are playing with party of 6 you won't notice any difference in your game because all party members will receive their XP.</p>
<hr />

<h3>3E Thief Sneak Attack</h3>
<p>Compatibility: BG2:EE, EET</p>
<p>Enables Thief sneak attack/crippling strike mechanics known from IWD and 3rd edition of pen-and-paper Dungeon & Dragons ruleset. It works exactly the same as in IWD:EE and replaces Backstabbing.</p>
<hr />

<h3>Adjust FPS and fix audio skipping in cutscenes</h3>
<p>Compatibility: BG2, Tutu, BGT, CA, IWD-in-BG2, BG:EE, BG2:EE, IWD:EE, EET</p>
<p>Seriously who still plays at default 30 FPS these days? I've been playing on higher frame rates even in 1998 and just can't stand sloppy gameplay on default settings. The only problem with adjusting FPS is annoying audio skipping in some cutscenes. This tweak should automatically fix most of such problems in vanilla Bioware content (just a guess based on what I've already tested). Of course if you are using non English voices that are longer than original ones (in such cases they are usually also problematic even on 30 FPS) than this tweak may be a little less effective, but you should still notice major improvements. Available options:</p>
<p><a href="#" onclick="toggle('Adjust FPS and fix audio skipping in cutscenes'); return false;">Unhide/Collapse details</a></p>
<ul class="vlisthide" id="Adjust FPS and fix audio skipping in cutscenes">
	<li><strong>60 FPS</strong></li>
	<li><strong>45 FPS</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Custom value</strong> (type in integer value up to 60)</li>
	<div class="spoiler">
		This tweak adjusts globally each Wait and SmallWait BCS action but only 1 line after DisplayStringX action is used, so it shouldn't really slow down cutscenes other than fixing the audio skipping problem. It also affects mods, but keep in mind that modders are often not following vanilla BG2 coding standards and either depends the delay on animation length or place delay timers not directly after the speech action is used, which currently won't be taken into account. This unfortunately is also true for content added by Beamdog, such as Black Pits adventure, where you will still experience audio problems.

<h3>More bandit scalps</h3>
<p>Compatibility: BG:EE, EET (BGT version available in <em>BGT Tweaks</em> mod)</p>
<p>More BG1 bandits shall have scalps when you install this component.</p>
<hr />

<h3>Put Sword of Chaos +2 in Sarevok's inventory</h3>
<p>Compatibility: EET (BGT version available in <em>BGT Tweaks</em> mod)<br />
Fully compatible with <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/files/file/1110-sarevok-related-tweaks/">Sarevok related tweaks</a> (load order doesn't matter)</p>
<p>This component allows you to pick up Sarevok's Sword of Chaos +2 after he is slain.</p>
<hr />

<h3>Protagonist can die</h3>
<p>Compatibility: BG:EE, BG2:EE, EET</p>
<p>Adds a flag to all areas in game to prevent Game Over screen when protagonist dies, but other party members are still alive (also affects mods).</p>
<hr />

<h3>Disable item shattering for enemies</h3>
<p>Compatibility: EET</p>
<p>Non party creatures in vanilla BG:EE couldn't shatter their items. EET offers the opposite by default, which I think adds to immersion. This component allows you to disable item shattering functionality for non party members.</p>
<hr />

<h3>Adjust BG1 weapon shattering chance</h3>
<p>Compatibility: EET</p>
<p>Adjust or disable chance for shattering after hitting with non-magical weapon in BG1 portion of the game. Default EET chance for weapon shattering is lower than in BG1, but shields, armours and helmets can also brake, so in the end there is still the same overall chance for shattering an item (1% by default when you combine all these chances). Available options:</p>
<p><a href="#" onclick="toggle('Adjust BG1 weapon shattering chance'); return false;">Unhide/Collapse details</a></p>
<ul class="vlisthide" id="Adjust BG1 weapon shattering chance">
	<li><strong>1%</strong> (default in BG1)</li>
	<li><strong>0.5%</strong> (default in EET)</li>
	<li><strong>0.2%</strong></li>
	<li><strong>0.1%</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Disable</strong> (weapons can't shatter)</li>
	<li><strong>Custom value</strong> (type in integer value from 0 to 100 - it will be divided by 10, so for example 1 = 0.1%, and 100 = 10%)</li>
</ul>
<hr />

<h3>Adjust BG1 shield shattering chance</h3>
<p>Compatibility: EET</p>
<p>As above but for being hit while wearing a non-magical shield in BG1 portion of the game. Available options:</p>
<p><a href="#" onclick="toggle('Adjust BG1 shield shattering chance'); return false;">Unhide/Collapse details</a></p>
<ul class="vlisthide" id="Adjust BG1 shield shattering chance">
	<li><strong>1%</strong></li>
	<li><strong>0.5%</strong></li>
	<li><strong>0.2%</strong> (default in EET)</li>
	<li><strong>0.1%</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Disable</strong> (shields can't shatter)</li>
	<li><strong>Custom value</strong> (type in integer value from 0 to 100 - it will be divided by 10, so for example 1 = 0.1%, and 100 = 10%)</li>
</ul>
<hr />

<h3>Adjust BG1 armor shattering chance</h3>
<p>Compatibility: EET</p>
<p>As above but for being hit while wearing a non-magical armor in BG1 portion of the game. Available options:</p>
<p><a href="#" onclick="toggle('Adjust BG1 armor shattering chance'); return false;">Unhide/Collapse details</a></p>
<ul class="vlisthide" id="Adjust BG1 armor shattering chance">
	<li><strong>1%</strong></li>
	<li><strong>0.5%</strong></li>
	<li><strong>0.2%</strong> (default in EET)</li>
	<li><strong>0.1%</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Disable</strong> (armours can't shatter)</li>
	<li><strong>Custom value</strong> (type in integer value from 0 to 100 - it will be divided by 10, so for example 1 = 0.1%, and 100 = 10%)</li>
</ul>
<hr />

<h3>Adjust BG1 helmets shattering chance</h3>
<p>Compatibility: EET</p>
<p>As above but for being hit while wearing a non-magical helmet in BG1 portion of the game. Available options:</p>
<p><a href="#" onclick="toggle('Adjust BG1 helmet shattering chance'); return false;">Unhide/Collapse details</a></p>
<ul class="vlisthide" id="Adjust BG1 helmet shattering chance">
	<li><strong>1%</strong></li>
	<li><strong>0.5%</strong></li>
	<li><strong>0.2%</strong></li>
	<li><strong>0.1%</strong> (default in EET)</li>
	<li><strong>Disable</strong> (helmets can't shatter)</li>
	<li><strong>Custom value</strong> (type in integer value from 0 to 100 - it will be divided by 10, so for example 1 = 0.1%, and 100 = 10%)</li>
</ul>
<hr />

<h3>Disable hostile reaction after charm</h3>
<p>Compatibility: BG2, Tutu, BGT (BGT version also available in <em>BGT Tweaks</em> mod), CA, IWD-in-BG2, BG:EE, BG2:EE, IWD:EE, EET<br />
<p>Simple tweak ported from BGT Tweaks. Changes the 'Charm Specific Creature' effect in all ITM, SPL and EFF files to disable hostile reaction after Charm/Dire Charm effect ends (also affects mods).</p>
<hr />

<h3>Adjust familiar death consequences</h3>
<p>Compatibility: EET</p>
<p>Normally when your familiar is killed summoner looses 1 Constitution point permanently. This tweak allows you to change this behaviour. Familiars in EET are completely unhardcoded, so adjusting such things is very simple. Available options:</p>
<p><a href="#" onclick="toggle('Adjust familiar death consequences'); return false;">Unhide/Collapse details</a></p>
<ul class="vlisthide" id="Adjust familiar death consequences">
	<li><strong>Constitution loss for 1 week + blocked familiar summoning for 1 week</strong> (after this time Constitution stat will return to previous value and you will be able to once again use 'Summon familiar' spell)</li>
	<li><strong>Constitution loss for 1 week</strong> (toned down version of above)</li>
	<li><strong>Disable Constitution loss</strong> (this one can definitely be considered a cheat)</li>
	<li><strong>Option 1 custom time</strong> (works the same as first option, but you type in how many days penalties lasts)</li>
	<li><strong>Option 2 custom time</strong> (as above, but for the second option)</li>
</ul></p>
<hr />
<!--
<h3>Adjust summon familiar selection</h3>
<p>Compatibility: EET</p>
<p>In vanilla game familiars are picked after Protagonist's Alignment. This tweak allows you to change it in following ways:</p>
<p><a href="#" onclick="toggle('Adjust familiar selection'); return false;">Unhide/Collapse details</a></p>
<ul class="vlisthide" id="Adjust familiar selection">
	<li><strong>Choose any familiar</strong> (choice is no longer dependent on Protagonist's Alignment at all)</li>
	<li><strong>Choose from the pool of 3 restricted to closest Alignment</strong> (for example Chaotic Good character will be able to pick up familiars normally assigned to Neutral Good, Chaotic Good and Lawful Neutral Alignments)</li>
	<li><strong>Choose from the pool of 3 restricted to general Alignment</strong> (for example if you have one of the Evil Alignments than you are restricted only to familiars normally assigned to Lawful Evil, Neutral Evil and Chaotic Evil Alignments)</li>
</ul></p>

<hr />

<h3>IWD:EE soundsets</h3>
<p>Compatibility: BG2:EE, EET
<div class="important">
<p>Requires IWD:EE to be present on your computer during installation</p>
</div>
<p>Imports all 30 soundsets from IWD:EE right into your BG2:EE / EET game. It covers not only media files, but also in-game subtitles (translation taken directly from IWD:EE dialog.tlk) and integrating it with GUI menu.</p>
<hr />

<h3>Add Priest of Tyr kit for Priests</h3>
<p>Compatibility: BG:EE, BG2:EE, EET
<p>Implements playable Priest of Tyr kit from IWD:EE (also present in BG2:EE Dorn's questline).<p>
<hr />

<h3>Add Priest of Tempus kit for Priests</h3>
<p>Compatibility: BG:EE, BG2:EE, EET
<p>Implements playable Priest of Tempus kit from IWD:EE.<p>
<hr />

<h3>Add racial enemies from IWD</h3>
<p>Compatibility: BG:EE, BG2:EE, EET
<p>Ranger racial enemies: Cadaverous undead, Giant, Goblin, Lizard men, Orc, Salamander, Spectral undead, Spider, Troll, Umber hulk, Yuan-ti. If any of these is already on the list than only description will be updated to use the more detailed one from IWD:EE.</p>
<hr />

<h3>Remove junk from global scripts</h3>
<p>Compatibility: BG2:EE, EET
<p>Both Bioware and Beamdog script coding lefts a lot to be desired performance wise when it comes to handling global scripts stuff (code that is working constantly for the entire game). This tweak aims to remove things from BALDUR.BCS and BALDUR25.BCS that can be achieved locally, which in the end should result in better in-game performance.</p>
<p><a href="#" onclick="toggle('Sane coding'); return false;">Unhide/Collapse details</a></p>
<ul class="vlisthide" id="Sane coding">
	<li><strong>Cleric's Holy Symbols</strong> - this is probably the worst offender. As far as I know <em>HasItem</em> action is one of the most demanding actions in IE games. In order to give Cleric a Holy Symbol at level 25 (something that will be done maybe once or twice in the late BG2 portion of the game) there are 18 blocks with this action that are parsed at the same frame during entire game, whenever global script is in use. Whatever was the reason for this (looks like a thing adopted from G3 BG2 Fixpack) the implementation is just bad. This tweak changes CDHLYSYM.SPL to spawn an invisible creature with local script attached that will do exactly the same thing without any performance hit.</li>
	<li><strong>Lilarcor (talking sword)</strong> - another situation where demanding actions are used without a good reason. Fortunately with a timer delay, but still talking weapons in global scripts are a known factor for FPS drops in IE games. Lilarcor has now new item effect added that will spawn invisible creature when item is equipped. I hope that other modders will consider using this implementation in future for their talking weapons, instead of following Bioware steps and bloating global scripts.</li>
	<li><strong>Unused test script blocks</strong> - BALDUR.BCS contains some leftover code used for testing textscreens that can be wiped out without any effect on game.</li>
	<li><strong>Unused Familiar script blocks with wrong DV</strong> - BALDUR25.BCS has references to not existing familiar Death Variables which can be safely removed.</li>
	<li><strong>Drow items changing to dust on surface</strong> - not so demanding for the engine thanks to the GetGlobal trigger, but still controversial when you consider that the same variable is checked 84 times in the same frame (even more if you are using mods that adds additional drow items) for the whole ToB portion of the game (only present in BALDUR25.BCS). This tweak will again spawn an invisible creature with local script, this time in all areas that sets <em>oh_drow_items_safe</em> variable to 0 (also affects mods).</li>
	<li><strong>Malchior Harpell´s appearance</strong> - moved the spawning method from BALDUR.BCS to AR0800.BCS. Due to this change it's possible to evade Harpell completely if you don't enter Athkatla Graveyard District (first place where you can meet him) with Drizzt's equipment, but I think that's still better than playing the game with 8 useless PartyHasItem checks. The way this has been coded (<a href="https://forum.baldursgate.com/discussion/30392/melchor-harpell-way-to-rip-me-out-of-my-immersion/p1">constantly respawning encounter</a>) is silly either way, so not much loss. I would call it improvement actually. No conflicts with <em>BG2 Tweaks - Keep Drizzt's Loot, Disable Malchor Harpell</em> component.</li>
	<li><strong>Leftover BG:EE ARE scripts code</strong> - this is unrelated to global scripts, but still worth cleaning. In 2 cases (AR0514.BCS, AR2001.BCS) leftovers can be harmful for BG2 portion of the game because there is junk BG:EE code in scripts attached to existing areas. That is why this component fixes it via REPLACE_BCS_BLOCK. Additionally there are 33 harmless ARE scripts leftover that don't have corresponding area files (they exist only in BG:EE) - these are also cleaned to make working with Near Infinity tool faster and more reliable (no false reports when searching for resources in scripts). Ideally, it would be officially handled by Beamdog <a href="http://forum.baldursgate.com/discussion/39661/junk-data-from-bg1-scripts-in-bg2-wrong-script-attached-to-are">via patch</a>, but until it happens this tweak will do the job.</li>
</ul></p>
<hr />

<h3>Restore TotSC textscreens</h3>
<p>Compatibility: BG:EE, EET
<p>In BG:EE starting and ending textscreens introduced in Baldur's Gate: Tales of the Sword Coast official expansion has not been implemented. This component restores them.</p>
<hr />

<h3>Ironman Mode</h3>
<p>Compatibility: BG2:EE, IWD:EE, EET</p>
<div class="important">
<p>Due to <a href="http://forum.baldursgate.com/discussion/40487/opcode-338-disable-rest-or-save-seems-to-be-partially-broken">engine bug</a> this tweak is not currently available, although early version is already present within the tp2 code and awaits for Beamdog move. Component has been mentioned here to increase awareness about the issue and show that it's actually worth fixing.</p>
<hr />
<p>Not recommended for first-time players!</p>
</div>
<p>Ironman Mode known from The Temple of Elemental Evil and more recently - from Pillars of Eternity where it is called <a href="http://pillarsofeternity.gamepedia.com/Mode?cookieSetup=true">Trial of Iron</a>. In this mode the player has one save game that persists for the entire campaign or until player's character dies (or whole party if you also install "Protagonist can die" component). The only way to save the game is by using quick save key (Q), which will also end the current session and move you to main menu. Being defeated results in the save file being overwritten. This tweak will also change current difficulty level to "Core Rules" if it is set lower and disable "Max HP per level" in ini file if it is enabled. Everything else is just like a normal game. In other words it's a famous no-reload challenge. If you are going to try it consider sharing your experience <a href="http://forum.baldursgate.com/categories/challenges-and-playthroughs">here</a>.</p>
<hr />

<p>Also take a look at the mod called <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/files/file/1091-isandirs-portrait-pack/">Isandir's Portrait Pack</a> which adds beautiful portraits made by <a href="http://isandir.com/">Isandir</a> in a style similar to vanilla BG1 portraits and few in BG2 style. The mod also swaps BG2 NPC portraits with Ust Natha themed ones during Underdark questline. Both components would probably end up in this pack if it would be available back then.</p>

<h2>Installation and Uninstallation</h2>

<h3>Compatibility and install order</h3>

<p>This mod should be installed at the end, after any mod that alters CRE, BCS, DLG, ITM, SPL, EFF files. You can safely keep it as the last mod in your load order (even after Widescreen and BP-BGT Worldmap), which will allow you to install/uninstall/re-install components during play through, without risking breaking other mods.</p>
<p>You don't need to worry about components installation order - weidu is smart enough to reinstall previous components if needed. For example you can install 'Party XP for quests distributed individually' before or after installing 'Adjust XP for quests' component. The outcome will be the same.</p>
<p>If you are going to use XP related components than you should avoid installing <a href=">"http://www.pocketplane.net/mambo/index.php?option=content&task=blogcategory&id=110&Itemid=83">Ding0 Experience Fixer (DEF JAM)</a>, as it does the same thing, but compared to this mod is less precise, flexible and doesn't cover mod related SPL, ITM, EFF files and new ChangeStat action added by EE engine (at least the version v6 that was the most recent one when I was writing this readme).</p>
<p>Don't forget to read compatibility section in the description of each component you want to install. If it is mentioned there that the same functionality is available elsewhere and you have conflicting mod installed already than installer will skip these components.</p>
